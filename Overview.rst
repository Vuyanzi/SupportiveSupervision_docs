Overview
========
The Supportive Supervision mobile app provides data beneficial for supply chain and commodity management undertaken by the government. Its features include data captured at the facility level on: human resources, storage and inventory management practices, resources and reference materials in use at the facility,availability and use of Information System records.This data provides parameters for monitoring the condition of the facilities and the services offered to the patients in a bid to promote high standards at health facilities. The app offers better two way communication since the steps involved during data collection and analysis are greatly reduced,i.e. the hard copy checklists are done away with. With the Supportive Supervision app, data collection is faster,data quality issues are addressed with information being collected and uploaded in real-time and data collection templates are automatically updated. This makes corrections and clarifications a faster and effective process . The Supportive Supervision app allows for collection and storage of data on your device when offline and to sychronise the information collected when internet connectivity is established with the online DHIS2 server automatically. This feature makes the app suitable for environments that have low or unstable internet connectivity.

.. note:: Supportive Supervision App is an open source project developed by a group of volunteers. The documentation team can always appreciate your feedback and help to improve the application. Kindly submit your issues and pull requests on the GITHUB REPOSITORY LINK!!!
