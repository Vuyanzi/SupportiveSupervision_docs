This section captures data on the condition of stores other than the Main store of the facility, through a set of questions presented in table-matrix format per store. The user enters a score against each corresponding store for the set of questions laid out. A summary score segment aggregates the total score based on a numerator and denominator to arrive at a percentage score.
